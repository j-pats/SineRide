I created a version using Unity way back that could run on phones, and re-purposed an old cellphone to act as a desk picture like the original post. This Unity version was far too resource heavy to be running continuously, not good enough for a picture frame.

This version has been developed in Processing (Java) to be lighter weight, and match the reddit post.
